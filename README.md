## Benefits
The package works according to the principle - fill out one contract - get all ready-made platform components.
### Platform decomposition
Components are separated by platform by style and behavior.
### One theme contract
Extension themes along with the ThemeData class are very good when you use widgets only for Design Material.\
In case you want to get the correct behavior of widgets for the platform, you must fill in Theme and CupertinoTheme and each time remember to separate these colors in the widgets you use.\
Theme Extension works in the same way as this package.\
In the case of this package - it is necessary to fill in only one contract of the theme used.
### Color scheme
The color scheme was created in terms of the convenience of designers (primary and secondary colors).\
In the scheme by name, permanent colors and tint colors are created (note - primaryLight and primaryDark).
### Boilerplate
Ready-made components dangeruce the declarative layout code.
### Simplified and unified API
Each package component has simplified APIs because some component properties are never used.\
All component property names are unified, for example, you will never see "background" and "backgroundColor".
### Disabled Components
Every component that can be clicked has the property to be disabled implemented.
### Basic entities
In addition to the theme, there are other basic entities that are managed identically to the theme - sizes, text styles and haptics.

## Design
Components follow the following design paradigm:
1) The component should not contain business logic;
2) All components must aspire to the behavior of the target platform;
3) If there is no such component in the target platform cookbook, a component is needed that will be as similar as possible to it and has identical behavior;
4) Component change the color of the disabled component, if it only has not background color;
5) Do not mix the design of cross-platform components and their behavior.

## Forks
The package uses a fork of the following packages:\
[animate_do](https://pub.dev/packages/animate_do) - fade animations.\
[animations](https://pub.dev/packages/animations) - transitional animations.\
[badges](https://pub.dev/packages/badges) - badges.\
[custom_rounded_rectangle_border](https://pub.dev/packages/custom_rounded_rectangle_border) - additional class for segment control component.\
[flutter_vibrate](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_vibrate) - all vibrations.\
[modal_bottom_sheet](https://pub.dev/packages/modal_bottom_sheet) - transitions that support modal animations and modal windows appearance method.\
[pinput](https://pub.dev/packages/pinput) - code fields and PIN fields.\
Express our gratitude to the authors of these dependencies.

## Usage
Initialize the main component widget at the root:
```dart
void main() => runApp(const MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FlutterComponent( // Initialize the component widget
      platform: TargetPlatform.iOS,
      theme: LightTheme(),
      size: Sizes(),
      textStyle: TextStyles(),
      haptic: Haptics(),
      child: FCApp(
        context: context,
        home: const HomeWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```
Usage basic components:
```dart
FCBasicButton(
  backgroundColor: theme.primary,
  splashColor: theme.primaryLight,
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(24),
  child: Text("Next"),
  onPressed: _next,
),
```
Usage ready-made components:
```dart
FCPrimaryButton(
  title: "Next", 
  onPressed: _next,
),
```

## Main entites
### Config
A standard config widget that exposes all of the package's abstract dependencies.\
Get the current config in the widget tree:
```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
```

### Platform
Standard enum from Dart Foundation.\
The default value is defaultTargetPlatform.\
Get the actual platform in the widget tree:
```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
final TargetPlatform platform = config.platform; 
```
The method allows you to change the current platform:
```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
config.changePlatform(platform: TargetPlatform.iOS);
```

### Theme
An abstraction of a theme that all package components use.\
The default value is [FCDefaultLightTheme](https://github.com/ivangalkindeveloper/flutter_component/blob/master/lib/src/theme/fc_default_light_theme.dart).\
There is also a dark theme for example - [FCDefaultDarkTheme](https://github.com/ivangalkindeveloper/flutter_component/blob/master/lib/src/theme/fc_default_dark_theme.dart).\
Get the actual theme instance in the widget tree:
```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
final IFCTheme theme = config.theme;
```
The method allows you to change the current theme:
```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
config.changeTheme(theme: FCDefaultDarkTheme());
```

### Size
An abstraction of a sizes that all package components use.\
The default value is [FCDefaultSize](https://github.com/ivangalkindeveloper/flutter_component/blob/master/lib/src/size/fc_default_size.dart).\
Get the actual sizes instance in the widget tree:
```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
final IFCSize size = config.size;
```
The method allows you to change the current sizes:
```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
config.changeSize(size: FCDefaultSize());
```

### Text Style
An abstraction of a font weights and families that text components use.\
The default value is [FCDefaultTextStyle](https://github.com/ivangalkindeveloper/flutter_component/blob/master/lib/src/text_style/fc_default_text_style.dart).\
Get the actual text style instance in the widget tree:
```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
final IFCTextStyle textStyle = config.textStyle;
```
The method allows you to change the current text styles:
```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
config.changeTextStyle(textStyle: FCDefaultTextStyle());
```

### Haptic
An abstraction of vibration functions.\
The default value is [FCDefaultHaptic](https://github.com/ivangalkindeveloper/flutter_component/blob/master/lib/src/haptic/fc_default_haptic.dart).\
Get the actual vibration functions instance in the widget tree:
```dart

## TODO
1) Duplication of all colors in ready-made components for easy overwriting;
2) Elevation of components;
3) Refactoring circular indicators from static methods to widgets;
4) Refactoring icons from static methods to widgets;
5) Refactoring text widgets from static methods to widgets;
6) Support WEB.
